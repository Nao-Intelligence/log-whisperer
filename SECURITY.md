We recommend always running the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Log Whisperer, **please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, report it privately by emailing **pranto@naointelligence.com** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days. Once the issue is resolved, we will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Scope

This policy covers the Log Whisperer CLI tool and its published PyPI package. It does not cover third-party dependencies, though we appreciate reports about vulnerable dependencies as well.
